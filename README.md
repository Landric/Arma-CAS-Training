# Arma CAS Training

A simple Arma scenario for practicing Close Air Support across an endless number of missions.

To tweak the Scenario's difficulty (e.g. time of day, resupply availability, generated mission types, etc.) run as a multiplayer game and change the scenario Parameters.

#### Mod Compatability
While this scenario can be played entirely in vanilla, it aims to be compatible with - and will attempt to load aircraft and factions from - a number of popular mods and CDLC if they are loaded, including: [RHS](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=843770737), [3CB](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=909680404), [USAF_AC130_BETA](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2226368165), and [S.O.G. Prairie Fire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227700/Arma_3_Creator_DLC_SOG_Prairie_Fire/).

If there is a faction or aircraft that you'd like to see represented in this scenario, leave a comment!

#### Known Issues
* Convoy missions:
  - Convoy routing is naive at best - they will likely never reach a sensible destination (but that's okay)
* Multiplayer:
  - Netcode not fully tested; expect odd behaviour
